                <p>Laravel programmers must have proficient knowledge of fundamental web technologies. They must have a thorough understanding of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to be able to build and deploy the applications.</p>
                <p>Prepare a list of interview questions for Laravel developers, including these technologies. Here's a detailed summary of why the knowledge of these programming languages ​​is essential for not just Laravel programmers but all web developers.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><b>HTML:</b> Hypertext Markup Language is the core of creating web applications. It uses tags to determine different types of elements and content. In simple words, because of HTML, one can differentiate elements such as the cover title, body text, and subheadings in a website. </p></li>
                    <li><p><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</b> Its primary function is to set how the HTML elements of your website are displayed on the front end of the page. In the website development process, HTML provides tools for structuring content, but CSS cleans it up and styles it. </p></li>
                    <li><p><b>JavaScript:</b> This logic-based programming language takes the website to the next level. One of its main features is to modify the website's content to give it a different behavior. All the CTAs or confirmation boxes that appear daily on the website are created in Javascript. </p></li>
                    <li><p><b>PHP:</b> It is a general-purpose programming language that can be used to develop interactive and high-performance websites. PHP could be embedded into HTML, making adding functionality to web pages easier without having to reference external files for data. Also, Laravel is one of the PHP frameworks, making PHP a more necessary skill for Laravel programmers. </p></li>
                </ul>

        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="hello-world">
                <h2>Hello World</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p><b>The basic example</b></p>
                <p>Open <code>routes/web.php</code> file and paste the following code in file:</p>
                <pre>
    <code>
    Route::get('helloworld', function () {
        return '&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;';
    });</code>
                </pre>
                <p>Here 'helloworld' will act as page name you want to access and if you don't want to create blade file and still want to access the page directly then you can use laravel routing this way</p>

            <header id="declaring-variables">
                <h1>Declaring variables</h1>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways: </p>
                <p>Inside the method. For example:</p>
               <pre>
    <code>
    $variableName = "Variable";</code>
                </pre>
                <p>Or if it is a property that can only be accessed from the controller</p>
                <pre>
    <code>
    protected $variableName;</code>
                </pre>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="data-types">
                <h1>Data types</h1>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Laraver have this data types</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>Null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant. </li>
                        <li>Integer 65466</li>
                        <li>Float 0.654</li>
                        <li>String "ALEX"</li>
                        <li>Array</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>And Objects</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="function-declarations">
                <h1>Function declarations</h1>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function.</li>
                    <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. </li>
                    <li>The PHP statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }. </li>
                </ul>
                <p> For example, the following code defines a simple function named square: </p>
                <pre>
    <code>
    function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                </pre>
                <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function. </p>
                <pre>
    <code>
    return number * number;</code>
                </pre>
                <p> Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function. </p>
